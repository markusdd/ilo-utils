I am giving this to any fellow suffering IT admins without any guarantees, but also without any obligations.
If you got here, you are smart enough to check administrative scripts before you run them and I will not be responsible for any damage caused directly or indirectly.

Nevertheless, you will realize getting this to run was a lot of work, so if this is at all useful to you, please follow the ko-fi link on the top of the Github page of the README.md file and leave me a tip. If you are a bigger organization and this really helps you to keep running with your HP G7 servers a bit longer, maybe think about redirecting some of the money you saved in not having to buy new hardware. I know there are a lot of you out there, and we all suffer exactly the same from HPEs lagging support mentality. So at least let's support each other.
